# 2a. Use an API call to create an authorization for $100. Provide the Payment Intent ID related to this authorization. >> payment_intent object
# 2b. Log into your Stripe dashboard (https://dashboard.stripe.com/) and include a screenshot of the payment page for the authorization you just created. 
# 2c. Use an API call to create a capture for $75. What happens to a charge if you only capture for a portion of an authorization, and not the full amount? 
# 2d. How do steps 2a-2c show on the customer’s bank statement? 
# 2e. Name and describe 2 distinct business models/use cases that would require auth and then capture at a later time.

const stripe = require('stripe')('{{TEST_SECRET_KEY}}');

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({

const stripe = require('stripe')('{{TEST_SECRET_KEY}}');

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.capture(
  'pi_3Sp0ZM2c6rQIzWO60bvyzctq',
